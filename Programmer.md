### 10-21-23

- **Created a file structure guide**
- **Steps made**
  - **Step 1:** initialized the project with vite and linked to the new github repository
- **Realizations**
  - `Vite` is used since `CRA` is `unavailable` and focused for Nextjs
  - `SwC` is `helpful` because it works `faster`
  - Don't `apply too much` `nesting` because it provide more `unnecessary nesting` level
  - `Lucide` used of `Icons`
  - It's hard to `chunk` your `developed` system especially it has already been `developed`. `It's harder` since you need to have a massive change in overall format
  - `Ideally` don't have a `Form` component since it should be a `page`
  - `What differs` a `component` from a `page` is that ideally you should include `all` the `processes` in the `page` whereas the `component` only needs the `format` of the page itself
  - **Libraries used**
    - Redux, SWC, axios, and lucide-react

  - `Writing` the `software` using `pen and paper` is `helpful`
